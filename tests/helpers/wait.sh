# shellcheck shell=sh
# Bounded polling for tests: wait for an observable state (a process has
# exec'd, a lock is held, a file appeared) instead of sleeping for a fixed
# time. A fixed sleep assumes the scheduler reaches that state in time, which
# fails under load; a shell job's $! is known before the command is exec'd.
# POSIX sh and bash compatible; sourced by the tests that need it.

# Runs COMMAND every 50 ms until it succeeds; returns 1 once SECONDS of wall
# clock time have passed without success.
